# Movies-ETL
Module 8 - Extract, Transform and Load

## OBJECTIVE
### Purpose: The current challenge has been an exercise in Extracting, Transforminig and Loading data.  We began with movie data from Wikipedia scraping and Kaggle.com.  After being extracted, the data was extensively reviewed, cleaned and transformed before being exported to SQL for analysis.


## Resources
- Source Data: Wikipedia-movies.json, movies_metadata.csv (Kaggle.com), ratings.csv (Kaggle.com)
- Software:  PostgreSQL, pgAdmin v4.30, sqlalchemy, Python 3.7.7, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas Library


## RESULTS
This assignment comprised four technical analysis deliverables:
  - Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
  - Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
  - Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
  - Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database

## SUMMARY
### With over 26 Million rows, the ratings.csv file was exported to SQL, but not before being cleaned up and made more useful.  Along with Wikipedia movie files received in JSON format, and movie Metadata downloaded from Kaggle.com, data had to be reviewed and condensed.  Corrupted and unusable information was largely discarded and useful information was condensed (duplicated removed), merged and put in formats that will be more readily useful for analysis.
